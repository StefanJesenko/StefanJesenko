### Hello, my name is Stefan Jesenko

## current occupation
I'm currently in my 3. year of education at the IMS Baden to become a software engineer.

In my free time I'm educating myself about the topic of AI, because this is the field that I want to work on and progress in the future.

In a SJF studyweek at USI Lugano I have worked on a Rock, Paper, Scissors AI that can recognise what sign you are showing with the camera, then there is an algorithem that is based on the previous moves that trys to predict the next move.
